### Project 2 Proposal

---

I plan to use [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) to web scrape my data. At the bottom of this page there is a list of links to all the NFL teams' stats pages (here is a link for one of the teams [Chargers](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sdg/2018.htm) :zap::zap::zap:. I plan to scrape all of these urls (32 in total). From here, I will scrape the data from the table labeled "Rushing and Recieving" for each team.

My MVP that I plan to tackle first is seeing the relationship between all-purpose yards and touchdowns. I suspect that with more yards there will be more touch downs, but I'm not entirely sure.

What I want to really explore is how many of the features of this table affect whether a player is selected to the ProBowl. You can see in the table, that there are asteriks next to some of the players. Whether a player has an asterik or not will be my binary response variable logit regression. From the output I'll be able to interpret the log-odds of making it to the ProBowl.
